## A Quantitative Timing Strategy

This is a quantitative timing strategy that I finished as a quantitative research intern at Guotai Junan Securities.
Based on Elliott wave principle and Fractal theory, I carried out preprocessing of over 10GB financial data and divided stock price action into trends(price going up) and corrections(price going down) to look for the optimal time to buy and sell stocks.
